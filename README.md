Introduction:

Potato crops are susceptible to various disease, which can significantly affect yield and quality. Early detection and classification of these diseases can help in taking timely actions to mitigate the impact. This project aims to develop a deep learning model to classify potato leaf images into three categories: Early Blight, Late Blight, and Healthy.The dataset used in this project is the PlantVillage dataset. 

Model Architecture:

The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The architecture includes multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, and fully connected layers at the end. The model is trained to minimize the categorical cross-entropy loss using the Adam optimizer.
